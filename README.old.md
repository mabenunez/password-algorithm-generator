# password-algorithm-generator

This project is intended to be a solution for the people who (like myself) don't like using password managers or random password generators. As they provide you with passwords you will never be able to memorize and will be forever dependant on the medium you are keeping all your passwords in.

This program will let you create your personal algorithm to produce passwords. All you have to do is choose the steps, and a phrase you can divide in two parts.

Even if you donÂ´t have a computer with you, you will be able to deduct what your password for acertain website or app is.

To run this project:
 - Clone it to a local directory on your computer
 - Run the comand $npm install 
 - $npm install
